ExcludeBlaze
============

What's this?
------------

The BackBlaze client contains a bug: whenever you select a new drive for backup, the list of exclusions is reset with no questions asked.

This tool keeps track of *non-default* paths in BZ's exclusion list, and allows you to merge them back to BZ's config after the list is reset.

This tool comes with NO WARRANTY. Even though it might work as expected, it's not a bad idea to back up your C:\ProgramData\BackBlaze\bzdata\bzinfo.xml before using this tool.
